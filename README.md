# MC202 Labs - Data Structures (Unicamp) 

These are my solutions for the **MC202 (Data Structures)** at Unicamp.

The idea here is to archive the code I wrote during the semester. Everything is implemented in **C**.

The codes are organized in the `tarefas/` folder, separated by lab number.

| Lab | Name / Nickname | What is it? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **00** | Warmup | Just checking the compiler. |
| **01** | Matrices | Dynamic allocation and pointers. |
| **02** | Linked Lists | Basic list implementation. |
| **03** | Doubly Linked | Circular and doubly linked lists. |
| **04** | Matrices 2.0 | More matrix and memory manipulation. |
| **05** | Deque & Dragons | Stacks and Queues applied to an RPG game. |
| **06** | Gattaca (BST) | Binary Search Trees for DNA analysis. |
| **07** | Schedule (Heap) | Priority Queue using Binary Heaps. |
| **08** | Hashtags | Hash Tables for text indexing. |
| **09** | Build Map | Graphs: Breadth-First/Depth-First Search (BFS/DFS). |
| **10** | Influencers | More Graphs: finding cliques and network connections. |

## 📝 Class Notes

Besides the code, I left a file named **`anotacoes.pdf`** in the root folder.

This PDF contains my personal summary of the course. It is worth mentioning that the content is based **almost entirely on the slides of Professor Rafael C. S. Schouery**, who taught the course.
